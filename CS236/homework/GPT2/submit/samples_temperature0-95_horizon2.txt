Crowdsourcing has gained immense popularity in machine learning applications for obtaining large amoeba-sized datasets and for understanding the dynamics of a social network. In the coming weeks the world of Crowdsourcing will take a turn to the next level, as it will see several different tools which will help to improve performance of crowdsourced applications.

In this review, we present the methods and algorithms used by Crowdsourcing to gather large data sets from a dataset and then apply them to a human-specific problem using crowdsourcing. We offer a brief overview to the methodology for

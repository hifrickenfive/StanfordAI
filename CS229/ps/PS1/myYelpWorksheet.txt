Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000 (PK is id), 8090 (business_id), 9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000 (PK is id) or 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id) or 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user 
	WHERE name || review_count || yelping_since || useful || funny || cool || fans
	|| average_stars || compliment_hot || compliment_more || compliment_profile || 
	compliment_cute || compliment_list || compliment_note || compliment_plain ||
	compliment_cool || compliment_funny || compliment_writer || compliment_photos
	IS NULL;

	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 	1	max:	5	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144

	select b.city, count(r.id) as review_counts
	from business as b inner join review as r
	on r.business_id = b.id
	group by b.city
	order by review_counts desc

7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
	
	There are two solutions: 
		a) the num of actual review records grouped by distinct user_ids
			There are only 10,000 records in this table
		b) the num of reported review_counts as reported by a column in the user table
			When you sum review_counts you get 242995
			
		Hence there is a inconsistency in the database
		
	Solution for a)
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	select r.user_id, count(id)
	from review as r
	group by user_id
	order by count(id) desc
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
	There are four users with equal counts of 5 reviews each - they are equal top third users

	| Yuri      |         1339 | -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg |

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	R2 score is 0.43, which suggests 40% of the review counts are correlated with the number of fans.
	This means that review counts is only one of many variables that explain the number of fans.

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: 1958
	-- 1780 that contains just love, 232 that contain just hate, 24 records that contain both
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select count(text)
	from review
	where text like "%love%" or  text like "%hate%"
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	select name, fans
	from user 
	order by fans desc
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

	+-----------+------+

	| Lissa     |  120 |


Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	I skipped this question because I didn't find the analysis question interesting.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
     
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
    
	The data suggests that businesses that remain open have average ratings greater than 3.0.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
	The data suggests that businesses that remain open have average review counts of 21.
	Businesses that are closed, on the other hand, have average review counts of 7.     
         
SQL code used for analysis:


	select avg(b.stars), b.is_open
	from category as c inner join business as b
	on b.id=c.business_id
	where b.city = "Toronto"
	group by is_open
	
	select avg(b.stars), b.is_open, avg(b.review_count)
	from category as c inner join business as b
	on b.id=c.business_id
	where b.city = "Toronto"
	group by is_open
		
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

	What are the average reviews of business categories?
	There must exist categories of businesses that people generally don't like vs. those that are liked
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    
	I need to join the business table and category table on the business id
	I want to select the category, stars
	review_counts to make sure there's a meaningful number of reviews
	distinct businesses to make sure theres a meaningful number of businesses in the category
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

	Worst categories
	Restaurants, and bars/night life feature most in the bottom categories
	Fitness trainers seem to get average reviews.

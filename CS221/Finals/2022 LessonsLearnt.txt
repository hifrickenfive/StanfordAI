Major
1. BFS does not give optimal solution
2. Search: state modelling to compute optimal result
3. Reinforcement learning: Epsilon=0 still modifies Q values, unlike Epsilon=1.
4. Reinforcement learning: Qpi > Vpi implies not optimal policy. Whereas Qpi = Vpi implies optimal policy.
5. Games: zero sum definition = 0 utility in all cases when adding opponent vs. my utility
6. Games: non-zero sum if there exists a case where adding utility of opponent and me != 0
7. CSP: Didn't know domains can be 'power set'.
8. Learning Bayes: EM algorithm, what is qi?
9. Learning Bayes: EM Algorithm, how to find hidden variable given 100 samples?
10. Logic: WTF is Modus Ponens, Horn Clause?
11. First order logic: wtf is CNF...?

Minor
a. Complex chain rule is intimidating.
b. Games: alpha beta pruning. Made error in computation :(
c. Reinforcement learning: adding scalar to all rewards. How to compute :(
